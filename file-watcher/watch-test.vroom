#!/usr/bin/env vroom-wrapper
#
# This simple program is used to demonstrate the watch feature in vroom.
# In the live-coding environment the program is reloaded whenever there
# is a change to the application's source code. It is possible to specify
# an additional file to watch, the same reload action will be triggered
# whenever there is a change to the specified file.
#
# To run the program,
#
#   ./watch-test.vroom --live --watch=params.txt
#
# Then edit the values in the params.txt. You should see size and/or 
# color of the sphere changed after saving the file.
#
# The first line in params.txt specifies the size of the sphere.
# The second line specifies the r, g, b color values.
